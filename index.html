          <h3>Marcus Lew - s3821420</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>I’m Marcus, I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I speak English and a bit of Cantonese as my family background is from Hong Kong. Graduated VCE at Careu Grammar and am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I love to play the guitar and piano, particularly jazz and classical. I am also an avid gamer! My passion in IT grew from the first time I built my PC in 2018, and using different gadgets that integrate cloud for seamless control from my phone.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>My strong points centre around Networking. Playing around with Cisco Packet Tracer I’ve learnt the basics of route and switch commands on Cisco devices. My main interests are the cloud, and IT for aesthetic purposes. Whether it is fancy lighting controlled from your phone or colourful PC components, if it looks good I’m all for it!</p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>My current HTML and CSS skills are quite basic, I look to further my knowledge in that department through this project. I also hope to gain some hands on experience working with either PHP or Javascript to add some functionality to this project’s site.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I see myself predominantly working on the coding side of things, however am open to cycling through other roles so all team members may have experience with different tasks.</p>

          <h3>Arjun Sharma - s3604973</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>I'm Arjun and my parents immigrated to Australia in 1990 from India and had me in 1997. I can speak Punjabi and English. I graduated highschool in 2015 from Westbourne Grammar School. I've always had an interest in techology and software. I enjoy playing video games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Pokemon TCGO. I've been playing field hockey since I was 8 years old.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>I am interested in many aspects of IT. Coding and software development is tough but very rewarding when completed and is one of my interests. Also web devolpment is something that I enjoy doing as it allows for a bit of creativity. Web security looks interesting but it is not something I want to persue in the future. </p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>I find deadlines and report writing to be my weaker aspects. I need to work on fulfilling requirements as per the criteria and staying focused on the tasks ahead.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I expect to be on the technical side of this project while also doing my share of report writing. I feel more confortable with coding and development</p>

          <h3>Jacob Bell - s3782072</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>General white European, i like playing video games and watching movies and have a strong dislike for programming. i like building expensive computers then using them to watch youtube videos.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>I am pretty good at explaining concepts and ideas both in text and through presentation, i enjoy and have an interest in design and creating functionality for products or ideas.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>Anything to do with programming, i am defiantly not terrible at it but overall i find it uninteresting and sort of boring. as a result i would like to develop skills in such a field hopefully over the period of this course. Some challenges may arise specifically in the programming section for the development of our website as most of us are fairly inexperienced in said work, despite this we should be able to complete our set project to a high standard.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I could see myself performing and undertaking the design and theory based sections of our assignment as i believe i am fairly proficient in both, i could also help with some of the programming but am relatively inexperienced with it and as such may cause some problems with the project overall.</p>

            <h3>Nicholas Santosa - s3844591</h3>
            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. Since 2007 and onwards I've been living in Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in Bahasa (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and I'm in my first year. I have finished school from Prep to Year 12. I went to Stella Maris in Point Cook for my Primary school and moved to Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus from year 7 to 12. I enjoy finding out how computers and the technology we use today works and how I can improve people's daily lives with this knowledge of the current technology.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>My strengths are communication skills, being organized, problem solving, research skills and being resourceful. I have experience in Python, Game Maker and Visual Basic. I'm interested in mostly the coding parts of a project.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>I would need more work on my CSS, creativity skills and leadership. I wouldn't mind developing any part of the project because I need overall experience in a project's life cycle, but I would like to be more a part of the code.</p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>I see myself doing the code for the project, but I would like to do all the different parts of the project at different times and not be stuck to one specific part of the project.</p>
