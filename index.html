      <h3>Marcus Lew - s3821420</h3>
      <!--[Background and Passion in IT]-->
      <p>I’m Marcus, I was born in Melbourn, Australia. I speak English and a bit of Cantonese as my family background is from Hong Kong. Graduated VCE at Careu Grammar and am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I love to play the guitar and piano, particularly jazz and classical. I am also an avid gamer! My passion in IT grew from the first time I built my PC in 2018, and using different gadgets that integrate cloud for seamless control from my phone.</p>
      <!--[What are you good at/interested in?]-->
      <p>My strong points centre around Networking. Playing around with Cisco Packet Tracer I’ve learnt the basics of route and switch commands on Cisco devices. My main interests are the cloud, and IT for aesthetic purposes. Whether it is fancy lighting controlled from your phone or colourful PC components, if it looks good I’m all for it!</p>
      <!--[What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs]-->
      <p>My current HTML and CSS skills are quite basic, I look to further my knowledge in that department through this project. I also hope to gain some hands on experience working with either PHP or Javascript to add some functionality to this project’s site.</p>
      <!--[What role do you expect to be performing in the project]-->
      <p>I see myself predominantly working on the coding side of things, however am open to cycling through other roles so all team members may have experience with different tasks.</p>

      <h3>Hello, my name is Nicholas Santosa. My RMIT student id is s3844591 and my RMIT student email is <a
            href='mailto:s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au'>s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.</h3>
      <!--[Background and Passion in IT]-->
      <p>I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. Since 2007 and onwards I've been living in
        Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in Bahasa
        (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and I'm in my first year. I
        have finished school from Prep to Year 12. I went to Stella Maris in Point Cook for my Primary school and moved
        to Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus from year 7 to 12. I enjoy finding out how computers and the technology we
        use today works and how I can improve people's daily lives with this knowledge of the current technology.</p>
      <!--[What are you good at/interested in?]-->
      <p>My strengths are communication skills, being organized, problem solving, research skills and being resourceful. I
        have experience in Python, Game Maker and Visual Basic. I'm interested in mostly the coding parts of a project.</p>
      <!--[What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs]-->
      <p>I would need more work on my CSS, creativity skills and leadership. I wouldn't mind developing any part of the
        project because I need overall experience in a project's life cycle, but I would like to be more a part of the
        code.</p>
      <!--[Challenges in context of the project]-->
      <p>One challenge we're all experiencing is being stuck in lockdown, some people have no motivation in this
        environment, but so far in all the projects I've been a part of, I haven't had any other major challenges.</p>
      <!--[What role do you expect to be performing in the project]-->
      <p>I see myself doing the code for the project, but I would like to do all the different parts of the project at
        different times and not be stuck to one specific part of the project.</p>
