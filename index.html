      <h3>Marcus Lew - s3821420</h3>
      <!--[Background and Passion in IT]-->
      <p>I’m Marcus, I was born in Melbourn, Australia. I speak English and a bit of Cantonese as my family background is from Hong Kong. Graduated VCE at Careu Grammar and am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I love to play the guitar and piano, particularly jazz and classical. I am also an avid gamer! My passion in IT grew from the first time I built my PC in 2018, and using different gadgets that integrate cloud for seamless control from my phone.</p>
      <!--[What are you good at/interested in?]-->
      <p>My strong points centre around Networking. Playing around with Cisco Packet Tracer I’ve learnt the basics of route and switch commands on Cisco devices. My main interests are the cloud, and IT for aesthetic purposes. Whether it is fancy lighting controlled from your phone or colourful PC components, if it looks good I’m all for it!</p>
      <!--[What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs]-->
      <p>My current HTML and CSS skills are quite basic, I look to further my knowledge in that department through this project. I also hope to gain some hands on experience working with either PHP or Javascript to add some functionality to this project’s site.</p>
      <!--[What role do you expect to be performing in the project]-->
      <p>I see myself predominantly working on the coding side of things, however am open to cycling through other roles so all team members may have experience with different tasks.</p>
