          <h3>Marcus Lew - s3821420</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>I’m Marcus, I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I speak English and a bit of Cantonese as my family background is from Hong Kong. Graduated VCE at Careu Grammar and am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I love to play the guitar and piano, particularly jazz and classical. I am also an avid gamer! My passion in IT grew from the first time I built my PC in 2018, and using different gadgets that integrate cloud for seamless control from my phone.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>My strong points centre around Networking. Playing around with Cisco Packet Tracer I’ve learnt the basics of route and switch commands on Cisco devices. My main interests are the cloud, and IT for aesthetic purposes. Whether it is fancy lighting controlled from your phone or colourful PC components, if it looks good I’m all for it!</p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>My current HTML and CSS skills are quite basic, I look to further my knowledge in that department through this project. I also hope to gain some hands on experience working with either PHP or Javascript to add some functionality to this project’s site.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I see myself predominantly working on the coding side of things, however am open to cycling through other roles so all team members may have experience with different tasks.</p>

          <h3>Arjun Sharma - s3604973</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>I'm Arjun and my parents immigrated to Australia in 1990 from India and had me in 1997. I can speak Punjabi and English. I graduated highschool in 2015 from Westbourne Grammar School. I've always had an interest in techology and software. I enjoy playing video games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Pokemon TCGO. I've been playing field hockey since I was 8 years old.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>I am interested in many aspects of IT. Coding and software development is tough but very rewarding when completed and is one of my interests. Also web devolpment is something that I enjoy doing as it allows for a bit of creativity. Web security looks interesting but it is not something I want to persue in the future. </p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>I find deadlines and report writing to be my weaker aspects. I need to work on fulfilling requirements as per the criteria and staying focused on the tasks ahead.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I expect to be on the technical side of this project while also doing my share of report writing. I feel more confortable with coding and development</p>

          <h3>Jacob Bell - s3782072</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>General white European, i like playing video games and watching movies and have a strong dislike for programming. i like building expensive computers then using them to watch youtube videos.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>I am pretty good at explaining concepts and ideas both in text and through presentation, i enjoy and have an interest in design and creating functionality for products or ideas.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>Anything to do with programming, i am defiantly not terrible at it but overall i find it uninteresting and sort of boring. as a result i would like to develop skills in such a field hopefully over the period of this course. Some challenges may arise specifically in the programming section for the development of our website as most of us are fairly inexperienced in said work, despite this we should be able to complete our set project to a high standard.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I could see myself performing and undertaking the design and theory based sections of our assignment as i believe i am fairly proficient in both, i could also help with some of the programming but am relatively inexperienced with it and as such may cause some problems with the project overall.</p>

            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>My background is Greek/Irish. My passion in IT is how IT is implemented into making video games. My hobbies are playing video games, and playing basketball.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>My strong points are that I am pretty decent at writing and explaining things, I am also not that bad at html. I am interested in the design aspects of websites and video games, and how IT helps with this.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>My weaker points are coding, so for our project, it will be difficult to help contribute to coding part of the AR</p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>My role will be to do some of the theory work, and also help on making parts of the website</p>

            <h3>Nicholas Santosa - s3844591</h3>
            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. Since 2007 and onwards I've been living in Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in Bahasa (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and I'm in my first year. I have finished school from Prep to Year 12. I went to Stella Maris in Point Cook for my Primary school and moved to Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus from year 7 to 12. I enjoy finding out how computers and the technology we use today works and how I can improve people's daily lives with this knowledge of the current technology.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>My strengths are communication skills, being organized, problem solving, research skills and being resourceful. I have experience in Python, Game Maker and Visual Basic. I'm interested in mostly the coding parts of a project.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>I would need more work on my CSS, creativity skills and leadership. I wouldn't mind developing any part of the project because I need overall experience in a project's life cycle, but I would like to be more a part of the code.</p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>I see myself doing the code for the project, but I would like to do all the different parts of the project at different times and not be stuck to one specific part of the project.</p>

            <h3>Joshua Kreppold - s3838911</h3>
            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>I come from Melbourne and have been here my whole life. After finishing year 12 at Yarra Hills Secondary collage I have moved on to studying IT at RMIT Uni.
		    I have to say my passion for IT stems from the fact I have always been close to and enjoyed using technology. What I find interesting and one of my main motivators for pursuing this industry is the many ways in which IT impacts our daily lives.
		    Technology is all around us and affects us in many ways, and I really like the idea of being in the process of using, creating, and understanding this new and current tech.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>Currently, I have had some experience varying around the field. In year 12 and 11 I took the VCE IT courses which were good and gave me some experience in the general IT field.
		    (Touching on basic coding with HTML, CSS, and PHP7 plus additional principals and knowledge).</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>I have also finished my first semester at RMIT which has already done so much for me in improving my weak points. Reflecting on myself i'd like to continue getting better at writing code as I am still only a novice. I am also hoping that as apart of this project in Building IT systems I will get better at my time management, research, and team skills. 
I believe the biggest challenge that will come from this project will be time management. </p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>Completing my allocated work for my group before our meetings. This is also one of my main goals, to stay on top of my workload. 
Tasks that I will be assisting in for my team ‘Groopname’ will be the completion of the “When section” and working with AWS. Other than that I will be assisting in any extra tasks I can, and would love to be involved in writing the CSS and HTML In the project.</p>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>Project overview - Our overall project idea is to create an online ecommerce website that will specialise in selling home electronics but with an additional feature focused around augmented reality, more specifically the implementation of augmented reality in the context of virtually placing a furniture item within an image or images uploaded by a user, giving said user a better idea of how the electronic products would look and fit within their own home. Besides that feature our website will contain all the normal features expected of a conventional ecommerce website.</p>
	
  <p>Project functionality and details - the augmented reality functionality will operate based upon two sets of information, the first being the item a specific user selects to view on the store and the second being the image(s) uploaded by the user of the room they wish to place said item. The item itself will be a 3D model that can be moved around the space by the user on top of the static image they have uploaded, the object will have set dimensions specific to those present within the item description. Due to this when the user uploads an image they will need to detail the dimensions of the room or a specific item in the room to allow the 3D model to be scaled correctly and give a better overall user experience. Although that will be our primary innovative feature we have added a few more conventional ecommerce website features to consider with the AR idea, those being as follows, a normal item search feature, a conventional purchase page, the ability to upload images and a wish list feature. </p>	
	<p>Below are a few diagrams and user stories to help better represent our project idea.</p>
