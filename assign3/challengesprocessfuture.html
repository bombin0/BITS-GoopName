  <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2><br>
    <p>The biggest challenge we acknowledged from the beginning was how we were going to implement an augmented reality experience. The idea of the project is to allow users to upload an image of a space, for example their living room, and to be able to accurately project a shopping item into that image space to see what it may look like in real life. What later became apparent was how we were to account for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Angle of image taken </li>
      <li>Distance of image taken</li>
      <li>Size and scale of items within the image</li>
      <li>Size and scale of the item to be superimposed </li>
      <li>How to detect the position inside the image in which the user wants the item to be superimposed in</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On top of such questions was how this was to be done inside a web application, and what tools and technologies we could leverage to achieve such a goal. There were talks in developing 3D models of products for ourselves, or finding 3D artefacts through existing augmented reality libraries. In the end this challenge was worked around through predefined hardcoded image layering to get the concept going. </p>
    <p>A major contributor to such challenges include time constraints and skill levels. For most members of the group, this was our first year completing such IT endeavours. Placing the challenge of developing an augmented reality experience upon ourselves required much more time, teamwork, research and technical skill. Teamwork is mentioned due to the nature in which the project work was divided between the group members, one MVF per member. Although we had two members assigned to the image handling and superimposition process, the superimposition process, aka the augmented reality aspect, was always going to be difficult for one member to handle. On top of this project, all team members had other educational commitments and projects, further limiting the amount of time we each could dedicate to this project.  </p>
    <p>With the departure of Christopher at the beginning of the implementation stage, we were required to shift the work, particularly in terms of report writing. We decided to change our original MVF 1 (which Christopher was in charge with), shifting MVF 5.1 to MVF 1, and assigning MVF 5.2 as just MVF 5. This contraction of scope allowed the team to still deliver all MVFs whilst still completing our report and presentation according to our timeline. </p>
    <p>This project brought many learning opportunities for our team members. One thing in common every team member had to learn was using WAMP. This was done so that we could each locally test our own site pages. Other skills learnt by team members include creating, writing, and reading to and from a database using PHP and phpMyAdmin. Not all members began with background knowledge on databases, and the database aspect was a necessity for MVFs 2, 3 and 4. In terms of collaborative platforms, all members have improved in their use of Github and InVision to perform collaborative work. These collaborative platforms ensured our work was coherent with one another, particularly with our MVF prototypes and our OES site. </p>

  <h2>Project Process</h2><br>
    <p>From this project, we have learnt how valuable good communication is to get things done. Team meetings have been vital to the success of our project as it was one of the major ways we could communicate our ideas and plans. It was also one of the more consistent ways we used to communicate with one another. Leveraging different team-oriented tools such as Microsoft Teams, Trello and Github really helped us with sharing our work and seeing what others have completed. What worked well for the group was the use of Github and InVision to share our works. Both tools provided a platform that enabled consistency and transparency throughout our project work.</p>
    <p>What did not work for us was the use of locally setup databases. Although we were able to share the sql code of the databases to try and ensure we each had the exact same database setup, some members were not successful in implementing their own local version therefore making it harder for them to complete their work. Another challenge this method presented was the consistency of our work. As we each had a local version of the project, some members were working on their own CSS styling for the site which brought consistency issues. In the end we communicated to one another how the CSS should be handled and ended up agreeing on a particular style. In the end there was some time wastage in ensuring that our works were consistent with one another which could have been avoided if a different method were adopted, such as hosting one database where everyone could access it. </p>
    <p>In regards to our teachers, they have been useful in terms of feedback given and reminding us of weekly work expectations. Particularly with our mentor A.B.M Russel, he has been keeping our project progress on track via weekly meetings, expressing his expectations for what should already be done, and what is to be done for the following week. It adds further urgency and accountability for all team members to make certain that the work will be done. Comparatively, we had fewer sessions with our lecturer Dr. B, however there was a key decision assisted by Dr. B that ultimately steered our project in a particular direction. That decision was what our project would be. In the early stages the group was struggling for innovative ideas. Our initial ideas included a simple e-commerce site and a music collaboration application. Both were denied due to lack of innovation or complexity reasons. The final idea approved by our lecturer was this augmented reality shopping site, and it was suggested that we take a website approach to this project, thus OES was created.</p>
    <p>Our advice to future groups embarking on similar projects would be to know each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and be transparent with one another. Hold regular meetings and keep everyone in the loop where you are in terms of project work, and always ask other team members if you are struggling. Most importantly keep communications high amongst the team. Only then will a group coalesce and be highly efficient.</p>

  <h2>Future Development</h2><br>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This section will detail the hypothetical scenario in which this project attracts funding from investors and i am
      placed as the head of management for this new project, i will have to hire 4 people with specific skills that will allow for
      the further development of the new project and its ideas, also creating new outcomes for said project in the process and
      ensuring these 4 employees are capable of completing these outcomes.</p>

    <h3>The outcomes and employees</h3>
    <p>As we will need to hire 4 people , we need 4 more outcomes that will improve our concept for the Ecommerce website and
        hopefully justify the money that has been given to us by the investors.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 1</h3>
    <p>The first outcome will be to implement the website on the world wide web, we need access to servers and the ability
         to store our data and users data on said servers. We need some person who has the ability to work with servers, keeping
         the physical units maintained and cool and ensuring they are running smoothly. We also need this person to have the
         ability to manage the virtual servers, link them to the website and our database (of which we will mention in the following
         section) as well as handle any potential issues that might arise as a result of any hiccups or mistakes within the system.
          A person who would be suited for this job will likely need to have a lot of experience working with servers of some kind,
          raid arrays, data management, databases and someone who also has experience in implementing said features with a specific
          website in mind, in this case, out website.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 2</h3>
    <p>The second outcome will be to increase the functionality of our database, adding more potential information and improving the
        functionality of every element and how they work together. Our current database is fairly simple as we are only focusing on a
        small portion of our website and as such, if we were told to expand the scope of our product we would need a much more advanced
        database. Hence the person who would be needed for this scenario would be someone with plenty of experience in developing
        enterprise level databases, utilizing the software to develop said databases and has the knowledge needed to implement that into a
        website. It could also be helpful if said person had some knowledge of servers as the primary form of data that will be stored on
        our servers will be information from these databases.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 3</h3>
    <p>The third outcome for this project would be to add additional features to the website style itself, overall making the website
        look more appealing to users and perhaps developing the new website with bootstrap functionality. To achieve this an
        entire redesign would be necessary, the colour scheme and logo would stay and probably the general layout but other than
        those things, everything else would need to be changed. The buttons and links on the navigation bar would be altered, the colour
        blocking on the different pages could change, the font and size of the text could change, drop down menus could be added,
        additional images and graphical elements such as moving pictures could also be added to the final implementation of the website.
        As such a person with experience in CSS , bootstrap, javascript and other such web programming languages would be needed for
        this assignment, preferably they could also possess some experience in developing and designing ecommerce websites in order to
        maximize the use ability of our new website.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 4</h3>
    <p>The final outcome would be to have everyone in this new group working together in a competent and efficient manner, we
        basically need somebody who is capable of becoming a team leader and organising all the elements of this project to
        ensure they operate to the highest possible standard. Someone who is experienced in leading a IT team would be most preferable
        for this scenario, as well as a person who has a very indulgent knowledge of the general IT systems that they will be
        overseeing during this project. Communication is key in this scenario, so somebody who is well aware of that should be
        targeted for the development of this new website.</p>

    <h3>Overall needs for this project</h3>
    <p>Although finding people with the aforementioned skills should be fairly simple, ensuring that they can cooperate with each
        other and all work together in an efficient and effective manner will be much more important as the project gets underway.
        If the group members cannot work together then the project result will most likely suffer, just having a team leader won't
        fix this, we need to ensure that each member is on the same page in terms of group work and is willing to give it their all
        in the development of the OES website.</p>
