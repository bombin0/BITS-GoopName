  <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2><br>
  
  
  <h2>Project Process</h2><br>
  
  
  <h2>Future Development</h2><br>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This section will detail the hypothetical scenario in which this project attracts funding from investors and i am 
      placed as the head of management for this new project, i will have to hire 4 people with specific skills that will allow for 
      the further development of the new project and its ideas, also creating new outcomes for said project in the process and 
      ensuring these 4 employees are capable of completing these outcomes.</p>

    <h3>The outcomes and employees</h3>
    <p>As we will need to hire 4 people , we need 4 more outcomes that will improve our concept for the Ecommerce website and 
        hopefully justify the money that has been given to us by the investors.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 1</h3>
    <p>The first outcome will be to implement the website on the world wide web, we need access to servers and the ability
         to store our data and users data on said servers. We need some person who has the ability to work with servers, keeping 
         the physical units maintained and cool and ensuring they are running smoothly. We also need this person to have the 
         ability to manage the virtual servers, link them to the website and our database (of which we will mention in the following 
         section) as well as handle any potential issues that might arise as a result of any hiccups or mistakes within the system.
          A person who would be suited for this job will likely need to have a lot of experience working with servers of some kind, 
          raid arrays, data management, databases and someone who also has experience in implementing said features with a specific 
          website in mind, in this case, out website.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 2</h3>
    <p>The second outcome will be to increase the functionality of our database, adding more potential information and improving the 
        functionality of every element and how they work together. Our current database is fairly simple as we are only focusing on a 
        small portion of our website and as such, if we were told to expand the scope of our product we would need a much more advanced 
        database. Hence the person who would be needed for this scenario would be someone with plenty of experience in developing 
        enterprise level databases, utilizing the software to develop said databases and has the knowledge needed to implement that into a 
        website. It could also be helpful if said person had some knowledge of servers as the primary form of data that will be stored on 
        our servers will be information from these databases.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 3</h3>
    <p>The third outcome for this project would be to add additional features to the website style itself, overall making the website 
        look more appealing to users and perhaps developing the new website with bootstrap functionality. To achieve this an 
        entire redesign would be necessary, the colour scheme and logo would stay and probably the general layout but other than 
        those things, everything else would need to be changed. The buttons and links on the navigation bar would be altered, the colour 
        blocking on the different pages could change, the font and size of the text could change, drop down menus could be added, 
        additional images and graphical elements such as moving pictures could also be added to the final implementation of the website. 
        As such a person with experience in CSS , bootstrap, javascript and other such web programming languages would be needed for 
        this assignment, preferably they could also possess some experience in developing and designing ecommerce websites in order to 
        maximize the use ability of our new website.</p>

    <h3>Outcome and job 4</h3>
    <p>The final outcome would be to have everyone in this new group working together in a competent and efficient manner, we 
        basically need somebody who is capable of becoming a team leader and organising all the elements of this project to 
        ensure they operate to the highest possible standard. Someone who is experienced in leading a IT team would be most preferable 
        for this scenario, as well as a person who has a very indulgent knowledge of the general IT systems that they will be 
        overseeing during this project. Communication is key in this scenario, so somebody who is well aware of that should be 
        targeted for the development of this new website.</p>

    <h3>Overall needs for this project</h3>
    <p>Although finding people with the aforementioned skills should be fairly simple, ensuring that they can cooperate with each 
        other and all work together in an efficient and effective manner will be much more important as the project gets underway. 
        If the group members cannot work together then the project result will most likely suffer, just having a team leader won't 
        fix this, we need to ensure that each member is on the same page in terms of group work and is willing to give it their all 
        in the development of the OES website.</p>
