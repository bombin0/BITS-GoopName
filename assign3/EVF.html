    <h1>Extended Viable Features</h1>

<br>

<h2>EVF 1 - Customer support</h2>

<p>The first Extended viable feature we wish to implement would be that of some level of customer support. We planned on 
  including 3 types of support, an enquiry form for users to ask questions directly from the website itself, and FAQ 
  section in where frequent questions could be displayed with detailed answers and finally a section dedicated to all the 
  contact information needed for users who have an issue or problem with the OES service.
</p>

<h3><b>Mock-ups</b></h3>

<p>This first image is a representation of the enquiry form detailed in the introduction. The user would simply enter 
  their first name and email address, along with their question and we would have some person on staff who would respond 
  to said question by sending them an email. This form will need to be included in the overall database of the website 
  and could relate to the user account section through the email entered. 
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>The next image details the FAQ section, in which questions asked by users can be inputted and answered, as to reduce 
  the number of enquiries we get on average. This section will also feature guides on how to perform some of the features 
  we have on the OES website, such as the Augmented reality feature present on all product pages. We have also included 
  what payment options we support on this page. The FAQ section itself will most likely expand as the website user base 
  begins to grow and as such more and more sections and questions will be added as time goes on.
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>The final image details the contact information for our company, any phone numbers and business numbers that we have 
  will be located here. All company emails and store emails will be located on this page as well. And all locations of 
  warehouses, headquarters and physical stores will be found on this page. If the OES company expands then so will this 
  section, adding more information as the company grows.
