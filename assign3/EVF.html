    <h1>Extended Viable Features</h1>

<br>

<h2>EVF 1 - Customer support</h2>

<p>The first Extended viable feature we wish to implement would be that of some level of customer support. We planned on 
  including 3 types of support, an enquiry form for users to ask questions directly from the website itself, and FAQ 
  section in where frequent questions could be displayed with detailed answers and finally a section dedicated to all the 
  contact information needed for users who have an issue or problem with the OES service.
</p>

<h3><b>Mock-ups</b></h3>

<p>This first image is a representation of the enquiry form detailed in the introduction. The user would simply enter 
  their first name and email address, along with their question and we would have some person on staff who would respond 
  to said question by sending them an email. This form will need to be included in the overall database of the website 
  and could relate to the user account section through the email entered. 
</p>
<img class="content" src = "assets/img/EVF1-1.png" style="width:50%;">

<br><br><br>

<p>The next image details the FAQ section, in which questions asked by users can be inputted and answered, as to reduce 
  the number of enquiries we get on average. This section will also feature guides on how to perform some of the features 
  we have on the OES website, such as the Augmented reality feature present on all product pages. We have also included 
  what payment options we support on this page. The FAQ section itself will most likely expand as the website user base 
  begins to grow and as such more and more sections and questions will be added as time goes on.
</p>
<img class="content" src = "assets/img/EVF1-2.png" style="width:50%;">

<br><br><br>

<p>The final image details the contact information for our company, any phone numbers and business numbers that we have 
  will be located here. All company emails and store emails will be located on this page as well. And all locations of 
  warehouses, headquarters and physical stores will be found on this page. If the OES company expands then so will this 
  section, adding more information as the company grows.

  <br><br>

  <h2>EVF 2 - Automatic Space Detection </h2>

  <p>The second extended viable feature we wish to implement is the automatic space detection for our augmented reality 
    feature. Basically we want the website itself to be able to automatically alter the location of the image and rescale 
    the product image size in accordance with some information the user inputs describing the picture they upload. 
    say ,if a user uploads an image of their lounge room table, they could input the size of the table and the website 
    would use that information to adjust the product image size and place it on said table. Overall this feature would 
    make the AR feature more attractive and usable for any person who wants to use it, and would be a great addition 
    to our website as a whole.</p>

  <h3><b>Mock-ups</b></h3>

  <p>This first mock up image shows how the general lookout of an individual product screen would look like, 
    with the newly updated AR feature. The top half of the page is dedicated to the product itself with all the 
    general information describing said product, the bottom half holds the AR feature section. It has a title, 2 buttons 
    dedicated to uploading and saving the image, a section for said image to be displayed as well as the areas 
    in which a user may enter the details of their uploaded image so that the website may adjust the size of the 
    product image to better fit in the space shown.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/EVF2.1.png" style="width:50%;">

  <br><br><br>

  <p>The next mockup details the steps in which a user must make in order to use the AR feature. First they 
    must upload the image of their room or space then they must enter the details shown below, then they 
    may click the ‘combine images button’. Details for this process such as instructions on how to use the
     feature and how to take a good picture could be provided on a separate page or a link of some kind.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/EVF2.2.png" style="width:50%;">

  <br><br><br>

  <p>The final image displays the combined image of the user space and the product. 
    The user may then save said image using the save image button for future reference.</p>
