  <h1>Project Background</h1><br>
  
<h2>Motivation</h2><br>
  <p>This project is an online web store specifically for electronics, and through the site customers are able to see whether they can fit the product into their homes. The motivation is to create a web store so customers can buy a product knowing that a new T.V or refrigerator will fit in the space they have allocated.</p>

          <h3>Marcus Lew - s3821420</h3>
          <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
          <p>I’m Marcus, I was born in Melbourne, Australia. I speak English and a bit of Cantonese as my family background is from Hong Kong. Graduated VCE at Carey Grammar and am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I love to play the guitar and piano, particularly jazz and classical. I am also an avid gamer! My passion in IT grew from the first time I built my PC in 2018, and using different gadgets that integrate cloud for seamless control from my phone.</p>
          <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
          <p>My strong points centre around Networking. Playing around with Cisco Packet Tracer I’ve learnt the basics of route and switch commands on Cisco devices. My main interests are the cloud, and IT for aesthetic purposes. Whether it is fancy lighting controlled from your phone or colourful PC components, if it looks good I’m all for it!</p>
          <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
          <p>My current HTML and CSS skills are quite basic, I look to further my knowledge in that department through this project. I also hope to gain some hands on experience working with either PHP or Javascript to add some functionality to this project’s site.</p>
          <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
          <p>I see myself predominantly working on the coding side of things, however am open to cycling through other roles so all team members may have experience with different tasks.</p>

            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>

            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. Since 2007 and onwards I've been living in Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in Bahasa (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and I'm in my first year. I have graduated at Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus at year 12 in 2019. I'm a car enthusiast and enjoy video games and sports such as tennis, swimming and soccer. I enjoy finding out how computers and the technology we use today works and how I can improve people's daily lives with this knowledge of the current technology.</p>

            <p>My strengths are communication skills, being organized, problem solving, research skills and being resourceful. I have experience in Python, Game Maker and Visual Basic. I'm interested in mostly the coding parts of a project.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>I would need more work on my CSS, creativity skills and leadership. I wouldn't mind developing any part of the project because I need overall experience in a project's life cycle, but I would like to be more a part of the code.</p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>I see myself doing the code for the project, but I would like to do all the different parts of the project at different times and not be stuck to one specific part of the project.</p>

            <h3>Joshua Kreppold - s3838911</h3>
            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>I come from Melbourne and have been here my whole life. After finishing year 12 at Yarra Hills Secondary collage I have moved on to studying IT at RMIT Uni.
		    I have to say my passion for IT stems from the fact I have always been close to and enjoyed using technology. What I find interesting and one of my main motivators for pursuing this industry is the many ways in which IT impacts our daily lives.
		    Technology is all around us and affects us in many ways, and I really like the idea of being in the process of using, creating, and understanding this new and current tech.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>Currently, I have had some experience varying around the field. In year 12 and 11 I took the VCE IT courses which were good and gave me some experience in the general IT field.
		    (Touching on basic coding with HTML, CSS, and PHP7 plus additional principals and knowledge).</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>I have also finished my first semester at RMIT which has already done so much for me in improving my weak points. Reflecting on myself i'd like to continue getting better at writing code as I am still only a novice. I am also hoping that as apart of this project in Building IT systems I will get better at my time management, research, and team skills.
I believe the biggest challenge that will come from this project will be time management. </p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>Completing my allocated work for my group before our meetings. This is also one of my main goals, to stay on top of my workload.
Tasks that I will be assisting in for my team ‘Groopname’ will be the completion of the “When section” and working with AWS. Other than that I will be assisting in any extra tasks I can, and would love to be involved in writing the CSS and HTML In the project.</p>

            <h3>Jacob Bell - s3782072</h3>
            <h6><strong>Background and Passion in IT</strong></h6>
            <p>General white European, i like playing video games and watching movies and have a strong dislike for programming. i like building expensive computers then using them to watch youtube videos.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are you good at/interested in?</strong></h6>
            <p>I am pretty good at explaining concepts and ideas both in text and through presentation, i enjoy and have an interest in design and creating functionality for products or ideas.</p>
            <h6><strong>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs?</strong></h6>
            <p>Anything to do with programming, i am defiantly not terrible at it but overall i find it uninteresting and sort of boring. as a result i would like to develop skills in such a field hopefully over the period of this course. Some challenges may arise specifically in the programming section for the development of our website as most of us are fairly inexperienced in said work, despite this we should be able to complete our set project to a high standard.</p>
            <h6><strong>What role do you expect to be performing in the project?</strong></h6>
            <p>I could see myself performing and undertaking the design and theory based sections of our assignment as i believe i am fairly proficient in both, i could also help with some of the programming but am relatively inexperienced with it and as such may cause some problems with the project overall.</p>

<h2>Aims and Goals</h2><br>
   <p>The aim for our online web store is to allow customers the ability to buy the right product for their space with ease. We intend to create an online store that will implement photo referencing technology to allow a seamless way to check and be sure that the customer will buy the best suited product for them.</p>
   <p>Our first and main goal to create this online web store is to create the seamless photo referencing technology to allow customers to fit a suitable product that will one, fit the space they possess and two, too find a product that they are satisfied with. This implementation will be simple and user-friendly. This main goal will achieve our main feature of the web store to give customers the assurance of the best product.</p>
   <p>Our second goal is to provide a service to customers that is simple and easy to understand, a website that will allow easy access to all electronics and provide the customer with the best outcome. We can achieve this with implementation of a wish list, our products page and customer account, it gives most of the work to the website to help the customer find what they need.</p>
   <p>Our third and last goal is to make sure the website is responsive and has minimal traffic. Due to the advanced features of our website we want to make sure that on the customer end it doesn't take too long for any action, we want to make sure that all commands and functions won't create any unnecessary traffic or lag. This goal will help give more control to the user and give the best experience using our online web store.</p>
	    
<h2>Scope</h2><br>
   <p>Our working prototype includes 5 features, these are search filters, wish lists, customer accounts, product database and our photo referencing feature. The search filters will give the customer easy accessiblility to any type of product they are interested in. The wish list give the customer easy access to previous products they are interested in, this is also linked to the cusomter's account. The customer account will create the website to be more simple allowing them to add products to their wish list, checkout simplicity and create delivery easier. The product database is to allows customers a wide range of products from the cheapest to the most expensive, branded products. The photo referencing feature is the most important and allows customers to referencing their product to the space in their homes to make sure that the product they're buying is suited for them.</p>
