  <h1>Wish List - MVF 2 for OES website</h1>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Marcus Lew</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Introduction:</h3>
  <p>The idea of the wish list is to allow for users to pin their favourite items. This eliminates the need for the user to remember the item or having to search for it in the products page again. By placing the users’ favourite products in one place, it also allows them to compare different items in the wish list side by side. This report begins by detailing the front end user experience of the wish list feature, then delves deeper into the making of this MVF describing the code and database developed throughout this project.</p>

  <h3>Front end:</h3>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish1.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>When first entering the wish list, if the user is not logged in with an account then they cannot use the wish list feature. This ensures that the wish list is specific to a particular user as different users will have different favourite items. </p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish2.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Upon login, users will see a change in messages to inform that they now have access to the wish list feature. They will also notice a new button appear saying <i>Clear Wishlist</i> which allows them to remove the items from the wish list should they wish to remove the items they add later on.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish3.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Looking at a product page on the OES site for a Samsung TV, users will be able to add this item to their wish list by selecting the button <i>Add to Wishlist</i>. This <i>Add to Wishlist</i> button appears on every individual product page only if the user is logged in, like the <i>Clear Wishlist</i> button in the Wish List page.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish4.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Users will be notified if they have successfully added an item to the wish list.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish5.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Users will immediately see the items they have added under the Wish List page.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/wish6.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>This is what a populated wish list looks like. Compared to our mockups of the OES site, we have stayed true to the grid layout of the items in the wish list. The only thing that was altered was that we had changed it to 5 columns instead of 3 as there were too many blank spaces. </p>

  <br><br>

  <h3>Code:</h3>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code2.JPG" style="width:100%;">
  <p>This is the code for the Wish List page that contains php, sql and html statements. </p>
  <p>Lines 1 to 3 in the code includes a fragmented php file that is consistent throughout all pages in the OES site, that being the OES logo, navbar and login / logout features at the top of each page.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code3.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>In the header.php file also includes a fragmented php file that contains the information of the database which the site pages will access as shown above.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code4.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Lines 10 to 18 in the Wish List code contains an if else statement which checks if there is a user logged in or not. This is so that different messages will be displayed on the page depending on the circumstance.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code5.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Lines 22 to 33 dictates the <i>Clear Wishlist</i> button feature. Line 23 is the actual button displayed on the site, however lines 27 to 31 is what makes that button work. To break it down, line 27 checks if the form posted has the name value of ‘delete’, if so it will connect to the database (line 28) and run the sql command “DELETE FROM wishlist” (line 29) which deletes the rows in the wishlist table located under the oesdb database. After executing that sql command, the site will display to the user that they have No items in their wish list.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code6.JPG" style="width:100%;">
  <p>Lines 40 to 69 is in charge of displaying the items on the wish list and in a grid like fashion. Line 40 ensures that everything contained in that div is presented as a grid, this is controlled via the following CSS:</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code7.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Lines 42 to 46 in the wish list code selects an item from the wishlist database table and checks if it gets a result. If it does get a result, then it will start feeding out data whilst there is still data inside the wishlist database table. It then goes into the while loop in line 47 which prints the data into their own individual tables which essentially separates each wish list item into their own cells. </p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/code8.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>The code above displaying lines 118 to 136 is taken from our Samsung TV product page. This allows users to add the item to the wish list. Like the Clear Wishlist button code, line 126 checks if the form posted has a specific name value, this time being ‘addWishList’ which is the name given to the input on line 119.  It then connects to the oesdb database, selects the product data under the products database table, then inserts the information into the wishlist database table. After this a confirmation message is shown to the user that they have successfully added the product to the wish list. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3>Database:</h3>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf2/database1.JPG" style="width:100%;">
  <p>With use of WAMP, we were able to host our databases using phpMyAdmin as shown above. This is where the wishlist table resides inside the oesdb database. Each item added to the wishlist table will be assigned an auto incremented wishlist_id, as well as the other four attributes that are passed on from the products database table when a user adds an item to the wish list.  </p>
