  <h2>Project Progress</h2><br>
	  <h3>Description</h3>
	  <p>We had some trouble initially when choosing a project as our first couple ideas were rejected due to not having enough innovation. We almost chose an idea pitched by Marcus of a music collaboration system where multiple people would be able to create music together simultaneously. Ultimately, we chose against this project as it seemed out of our capabilities although innovative, and chose instead to create a web-based electroninc store that would allow customers to visualise their products within their homes via an inbuilt AR function.</p>
	  <p>Our very first dead end was encountered when we decided to do a general e-commerce website, this idea was rejected and said it wasn’t innovative. Our dead end was then overcome with Joshua’s idea and became the project we created.</p>
	  <p>Our first pivotal decision was what project we would like to create. We were debating over an e-commerce website and a music collaboration system. We ended up favouring the e-commerce website as our skillset was not advanced enough for the complex project. Another decision we needed was what MVFs were to be created for our e-commerce website and who was in charge of each MVF. These MVF’s were decided by the whole group and were Search filters, Wish List, Checkout functionality, List of Products, Superimpose Item and Upload Photo. These MVFs were later changed to finally become Upload Photo, Wishlist, Customer Account, List of Products (database) and Superimpose Item. The group members that are in charge of each MVF are Jacob for Upload Photo, Marcus for Wish List, Nicholas for Customer Account, Arjun for List of Products (database) and Joshua for Superimpose Item. We also needed to decide what each other's roles were, that’s where we decided to swap the roles after each assignment to keep everyone having experience in different parts of the project, we split up into groups of two being Nicholas and Joshua, Marcus and Arjun, and Jacob and Chris.</p>
	  <p>Our first changes were to move Customer Account from an EVF into an MVF and put the Checkout Functionality into an EVF and we had too many MVFs and made Upload Image and Superimpose Item into one MVF with two parts. The second change was that we didn’t have enough time to create a full list of products and turned it into a small set of products of our choosing. The last change to our MVF’s was that one of our team members stopped working on the project and their MVF, search filters, was removed and to get 5 MVFs we split Upload Photo and Superimpose Item into separate MVFs again.</p>
	  <p>Our main innovative idea of this project was to create an AR experience to allow customers to test products from the comfort of their homes. We had to compromise with the time constraint and our collective current skill sets that we created a functional, but counterfeit AR experience for customers to view and try-out products from their homes. Our Extended features were also a goal that we weren’t able to complete, due to the time constraint of this project. We wanted to implement a checkout function, customer support and automatic space detection.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Outcomes to date</h3>
	  <p>Our outcome is to have all five of our minimal viable features to be demonstrable for our e-commerce website. We set out to implement Upload Photo, Wish List, Customer Account, List of Products (database) and Superimpose Item functions to our website. Out of the five minimal viable features we set out to achieve we have completed the implementation of 4 and most, but not the full implementation of our 5th MVF. The MVFs we were able to fully implement into our e-commerce site were the Upload Photo, Wish List, Customer Account and List of Products (database).</p>

	  <h3>EVFs</h3>
	  	<a href="EVF.html">EVFs</a>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Scope Creep</h3>
    <p>The scope of the project has changed a considerable amount since we started. We have removed three of the initial MVFs (Shopping Cart, Search Bar, Superimpose Image) while adding the ‘Customer Account’ EVF as a new MFV. We also changed MVF 1 from ‘Search bar’ to ‘Upload Image’. There are multiple factors at play causing this scope contraction. Firstly, the departure of a team member has resulted in the change of MVF 1 thus changing our scope. Other factors that contributed to this scope contraction was time constraints and current skillsets. With our current skillsets, there was much research and learning to be done before executing our MVFs. This includes learning to use technologies such as WAMP and Github, and also learning new database and web programming concepts we have not come across before. Above all with all team members having other projects and educational commitments, this only added to the time constraints already at hand.  </p>
	  <p>Scope Creep has also been a factor within our MVF 5.  As research was done we came to the conclusion that automatic space detection within a still image was either not possible or would require a skill set much higher than any of us in the group. There is AR technology available to capture automatic space detection within a camera and place a model on a surface as we wanted, but as our site is web browser orientated we were limited to technology that needs to work on a pc or desktop. Due to that, the alternative way to create this function was to overlay the model image over the user uploaded image.</p>
	<h3>Windfall</h3>
    <p>Of the five MVFs, a quicker way was discovered for MVF 5 – Superimposing item. Albeit faster, it did not result in an over generous estimation of times as the process still required much research due to the MVFs difficulty. The quicker solution does not result in an authentic augmented reality experience in which a three-dimensional artefact is superimposed into a space, but rather just an image layered on top of another. The current image layering solution was implemented out of necessity in terms of time and skillset, further elaborated under Challenges and Learning.  </p>

    </table>
    <p>For the most part, our progress has been on track in comparison to our timetable. What lagged behind was getting our MVFs into a common platform, that being Github. Although scheduled to be done during week 10 ready to be showcased during group presentations, instead this was accomplished during week 11. What went positively well was the group presentation during week 11 in which we were on track with 3 MVFs integrated onto our OES site. </p>
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>To test our site we used WAMP to locally host each of our MVF pages. There were difficulties that came with this as each team member needed a local version of the database in order to view the PHP files. This became apparent for MVFs 2 and 3 (wish list and customer account) because it was not possible to view our workings unless we had an exact copy of the databases created under MVF 4. Next time should time permit, we would have tried to learn and proceed to host a database where all members can access it on a server. That way team members can freely view and test their site pages, as well as eliminating the need to tell every team member to update their local database if any changes were made to it.</p>
