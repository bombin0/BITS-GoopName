	<h2><b>MVF Implementation</b></h2>
		<p>As implimentation and reaserch was done for this MVF, scoop creep changed the way it would be done. This MVF changed from the idea 
      of an Augmented reality function to rather an image overlay function. This was done due to the fact that there isn't a standared for displaying
    an image within another image still image to scale on a web browser. The way we were looking to do this was by having the user upload an image an that 
  fits within parameters as to have an educated guess that it will look right. </p>
  <br>
  <P>After the user has <a href= "mvf1.html">uploaded</a> their background image the goal of this function was to display a model of the product they are 
    on overlayed on the uploaded image. This if position correctly would make the product look as if it is actually there. </P>
