	<h2><b>MVF Implementation</b></h2>
		<p>As implimentation and reaserch was done for this MVF, scope creep changed the way it would be done. This MVF changed from the idea 
      of an Augmented reality function to an image overlay function instead. This was done due to the fact that there isn't a standared for displaying
    an image within another image still image to scale on a web browser. 
    The way we were looking to do this was by having the user <a href="mvf1.html">upload</a> an image that 
  fits within specific parameters as to have an educated guess that the two images will come together right.</p>

  

   

    <h3>Model Image</h3>
    <p>At this point what the function will do is connect to the product database and grab an image based on which product page you are on.
      If you're on the on the samsung TV product page the image model used will be the samsung respectivily. PHP will be used to decide which what image we are 
      going to try pull from the DB . After which the model image is grapped and is placed over the user uploaded background image.
    </p>
    <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf5/DisplayProduct-code.jpg" style="width:50%;">
    

    <h3>Positioning</h3>
    <p>Once we are able to display both images on the page, what remians is positioning them correctly to one another as to fulfil the
       overall purpose of this function. The trouble with this is that proper scale may not always be showen correctly, so the viable solution to
       this was to give the user some parameters before they upload the image, namely specifics that will make it more likly for their image
       to fit well with our product image.
    </p>
    <p>Even still it's hard to get the images to overlay perfectly, in future we'd need to revaluate the way this functions works as to improve the quality of what it does. </p>
