<h1>List of all tools and technologies used by the group.</h1>

<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>Microsoft teams is a website and an application that allows for video and audio meetings between multiple people as well as the exchange of text and 
  files over channels. In the case of this assignment Microsoft teams was used to perform meetings with our tutor , lecturer as well as host meetings 
  between all of our group members on a weekly basis.
</p>

<h3>Github </h3>
<p>Github is a website and desktop application that allows users to store files within a cloud server, groups may be made from multiple users that 
  allows said users to share files, upload files and update files all from one space. In the case of  this assignment  , github was primarily 
  used for the storage of any and all html, css, php , javascript and any other files needed for the creation of our AWS hosted website.
</p>

<h3>Google docs </h3>
<p>Google docs is basically a form of text editor such as Microsoft Word in which an individual may create a report or typed document. 
  The difference between google docs and other text editors is that all files created using docs are stored on google's cloud servers 
  and linked to google accounts, these files may also be worked on by multiple users at one time. Hence we primarily  used google docs 
  for collaborative work such as written documents or planning documents.
</p>

<h3>AWS</h3>
<p>Amazon web services is a website that allows for the hosting of web pages through the upload of all the necessary code, said code 
  is uploaded into one place, similarly to github, and the AWS service will enable the generation of a website link to which other people 
  may view the website without having any of the files. This was used for the submission of our website.
</p>
	  
<h3>Trello</h3>
<p>Trello is a website dedicated to the creation and maintenance of ‘boards’ in which users may upload files, fill out information, 
  create checklists, all in the goal of managing time and progress within a group environment. Trello allows every individual group 
  member the ability to view the progress of other members and the group as a whole and allows the teachers to view the progress of a specific group.
</p>

<h3>Image editor</h3>
<p>An image editor such as paint.net or photoshop was used by all group members when designing the low fidelity mockups of the 
  MVF’s , as well as when we developed the high fidelity mockups for the EVF’s as InVsion requires a base image in order to 
  utilize its full feature list. Again , the type of editor that was used did not matter, as long as the file type was readable by 
  every group member.  </p>

<h3>Text Editors</h3>
<p>Text editors such as visual studio code or notepad++ were used by all group members in order to create the code necessary 
  for our website. It did not matter which editor each group member decided to use, as long as they saved the files in the correct 
  format, everything was fine and worked as intended.
</p>

<h3>Wampserver </h3>
<p>Wampserver is an application that allows a user to recreate a server environment through their local network, as such, we 
  have used this service to test PHP files as well as any SQL databases that we needed for this assignment and to test the 
  overall functionality of the completed website with these added functions.
  </p>

<h3>Invision</h3>
<p>InVision is a prototyping tool used to create high-fidelity mockups of whatever you need, utilizing images created by the 
  designer and adding clickable areas and other visual features that allow a user to get a solid overview of how the final 
  product will look. For this project we use invision to create the mock ups for our individual MVF’s as well as the EVF’s 
  as can be seen on the ‘EVF’ section of this website.
</p>

<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>MySQL is a tool used to create and alter databases under the SQL language, it is relatively in depth but fairly simple to 
  learn, especially for a smaller scale website such as the one we have created. For this assignment we used MySQL to create 
  the database for the website which features elements from all the MVF’s such as account id’s and image names as some examples.</p>

<h1>Architecture</h1>

	  <p>This diagram shows the architecture of our OES e-commerce webstore. It displays what are the processes of each of our current features.</p>

<h1>Group member Tools and Technologies proficiency table.</h1>
<p>This is a table that will display the proficiency of every individual group member with every individual tool and technology on a 
  scale of 1 to 3, where 1 is low, 2 is average, and 3 is high.</p>
