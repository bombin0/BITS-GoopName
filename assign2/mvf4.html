  <h1>Product List (database) - MVF 4 for OES website</h1>

  <p>Team member in charge of MVF – Arjun Sharma</p>

  <br>

  <h3>MVF description and low fidelity mock-up</h3>
  <p>The purpose of the product list is to have an interface that displays all the categories of products and also all the individual variants of these categories. This feature is a requirement from a user interface standpoint as it will create a smoother experience for the user when navigating our website.</p>
  <p>Along with the product list I will also be creating a database to contain all the product information that will be displayed in the product list.</p>
  <p>The following low-fidelity diagram was made using inVision and highlights the basic layout of what the product list will look like when implemented into our website.</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf4/lowFidmvf4.jpg" style="width:50%;">

  <br>

  <h3>System context diagram and high-fidelity mockups</h3>
  <p>In order to visualise the database, I have created an Entity Relationship Diagram as a design artifact for this mvf:</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf4/ER_Diagram.png" style="width:50%;">
  <p>Basic System context diagram for the product list:</p>
  <img class="content" src = "assets/img/mvf4/mvf4_SystemContextDiagram.JPG" style="width:50%;">
  <p>In the High fidelity mockups I have added a page that displays all the categories in a single area that acts as a focus point for the user to navigate. This page also includes a section highlighting new products that were recently added to our database.</p>
