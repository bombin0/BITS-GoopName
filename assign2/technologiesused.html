    <h1>Technologies used</h1>

<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
<p>Microsoft teams will be primarily used to host and record team meetings as well as to post any questions that someone may have while working on the project.
</p>

<h3>Trello </h3>
<p>This will function as a page to store any and all information relating to the progress of our assignments and project overall,
   giving a full overview of what was done and when it was completed.
</p>

<h3>Github </h3>
<p>Github will be used to host and store any code files for use on our website and acts as a place for everyone to access said files. These files can be altered
   by anyone in the group, so that we can work on the project collaboratively.
</p>

<h3>Google Docs</h3>
<p>Docs will be used for storage of any large text sections that will be present on our e-commerce site and will allow for a cloud based storage section for everyone to utilize.
</p>
	  
<h3>Google Sheets</h3>
<p>We used Google Sheets to put the 'Estimation Times' template and work on the table collaboratively.
</p>

<h3>Invision</h3>
<p> Invision will be our primary tool for the design of our
   prototypes and will be used by all groups members to create said prototypes of our MVFâ€™s. </p>

<h3>Text Editors</h3>
<p>As we will be creating a webpage we will need some form of advanced text editor to edit and create HTML5,
   CSS3, php and any other forms of files we would need for this assignment. Tools the group will be using will include common 
   text editors such as visual studio.
</p>

<h3>Image Editor </h3>
<p>An image editor may also be used in creating and combining some of the diagrams we need for this assignment,
   it doesn't really matter which editor is used as long as the file types are compatible across all team members devices.</p>

<h3>Amazon Web Services</h3>
<p>Our webpage will eventually need to be hosted for submission, and as such we will again be using AWS for this section of our assignment. Specifically the s3 services.
   We will also use AWS to create and store our databases for our online e-commerce site.
</p>

<h3>WampServer</h3>
<p>WampServer is used to create web applications from Apache2, PHP, MySQL and MariaDB. Used to create our 'Upload Photo' and 'Superimpose Photo' features.</p>
