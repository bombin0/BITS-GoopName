  <h1>Detailed Estimation Plan - Upload Image - MVF 5.1 for OES website</h1>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Jacob Bell</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>This feature encompasses the first of two segmented parts of our main innovative project idea, that being the Augmented reality photo feature. This section will focus on enabling the user the ability to upload their own images onto the website as well as save images generated by the AR feature. Images will be normally that of rooms or spaces in which a user would like to view a certain product in, for example; a user may wish to see how a television would look on their living room table, they would upload an image of the table, use the AR feature, an image would then be generated of the product being superimposed onto the user image and then that person would have the ability to save the image for future reference. This MVF encompases everything to do with the user uploading and saving images but not the actual generation of the images themselves, that will be discussed in MVF 6.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>the learning of how to implement a feature that allows a user to upload images to a website, have the website store said image and display said image, as well as allowing them to download the image back onto their system, although seemingly fairly simple, could prove difficult to implement in relation to my other group members work on the website. Due to this I would assume the learning process to take 4-6 hours and an additional hour or so to brush up on details while developing the feature during assignment 3.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>the research process would most likely involve viewing websites with similar features and understanding how to make the upload buttons and style easy to use and visually appealing to the user. The research may also include how to utilize some form of database for storing the images uploaded by the user. This process would take no longer than 6-7 hours, especially since my group members may already have the style for said buttons created and a few will already be working on the database portion of our website.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>the design portion will be very simple for MVF 5 as we as a group have already decided on how the overall design of the website will look, we have developed a backbone CSS file to fit said design and the upload and save image buttons will most likely fall under the file. It is simply a matter of coordinating with the group member working on MVF6 in order to get the placement of the buttons correct. As such this should take no longer than 2-3 hours at max.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>this will encompass the largest portion of time for this specific MVF. The coding section will involve the entire implementation of everything I had gathered during the previous steps and applying said information to the OES website, specifically inside the Augmented reality feature that will work in conjunction to MVF 6. As such I will again need to work closely with my group members as to who will be working on the HTML files first, who will be organising the page layout and CSS design and overall how we will all incorporate each MVF together and still retain a fully functional website. Due to this I expect this section to take upwards of 10-15 hours to complete fully by the end of the semester.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>perhaps the most important section, the testing we will be doing will primarily involve the relationship between MVF5 and MVF6 and ensuring they work together flawlessly, a user should be able to upload a photo, generate a superimposed image and save said image all within a reasonable timeframe. As such we will spend around 7-10 hours not only on this section but on the website as a whole to ensure that it is up to par with our goals and expectations and to fix any issues that occur if said expectations are challenged.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>this MVF, although important to our overall idea will not encompass that much time in comparison to the other ones, as such, if my predictions are correct, i will have ample time to assist my teammates in producing an overall better product ahead of our submission date for our final assignment. The total time spent on this MVF will total around 30-35 or so hours.</p>
