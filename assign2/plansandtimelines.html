   <h2>Search Filters - MVF 1 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Christopher Priskas</p>
  
  <br>
  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>The search filters are basically all the different ways to search for a different product, so there will be a search bar, where you can search for a specific product to come up, there will also be different tabs on the side where you can look at a range of specific products. Such as looking at all the small fridges, or if you want you can look at all fridges, both large and small. </p>
  <br>
  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>
  <p><b>Learning</b></p>
  <p>To be able to learn this, you would need to know how to both implement the search bar as well as all the side tabs, which will all have to direct towards certain pages with the correct items. This learning process would take about 4 hours.</p>
  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>Researching how this feature works and how I would implement it onto our website, so I would look at other websites and what their search filters are and how they work. Also how to make the search filters look good on the page. This process would take about 3 hour.</p>
  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>The design aspect of this feature will be fairly simple, since I am in a group and the group already has a general design for the whole website, and a completed css. So my main contribution to the design would be the side tab and how all the tabs look and if they fit in correctly and look pleasant for the user. This process will take about 3 hours</p>
  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>The coding step will require me to put together everything I have gathered so far and then implement how everything actually works. So I would have to have all the different search filters working correctly. This process will take about 6 hours</p>
  <p><b>Testing</b></p>
  <p>The testing will require us to test the search filters so they work, this will require that all the different search filters take you to the correct page, and if anything does not work, then we will need to fix it, so this process will take about 4 hours. </p>
  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 20 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 4 to 5 working days to develop functional search filters. </p>

  <h2>Wish List - MVF 2 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Marcus</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>The wish list is to enable customers to easily pin and access their favourite products on the site. On each product page, customers will have the ability to pin an item, then access it via their “wish list”. This displays all their favourite items in one organised area so they do not need to search for it again. The wish list will also allow the user to sort how their wish list is being viewed via filters. Users will be able to sort their wish list by most recently added, price and in alphabetical order of product.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>9 hours - Taking into account how little experience I have with PHP, it would be essential to look and work through different tutorials and examples on how to develop a wish list. I will also be learning how to work with multiple databases, one being the product database and the other being the customer accounts. I will be learning how to pull information from each database and display that information in the wish list. I will also need to learn how to update a database when something is added to the wish list, it will need to be saved to the customer account database.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>5 hours - Research would require me to find different resources and tools to implement in my wish list. An aspect not to be overlooked is also how a wish list is to be displayed to the user, hence looking at other sites with wish lists will be helpful in designing our wish list. Importantly I will have to do some research on PHP and how to leverage that to build this MVF.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>2 hours - With the research to be done on how a wish list should be designed, the overall time to complete the design should only take a maximum of two hours. This is also taking into account that page frameworks would have already been established, so there will be no need to design other features such as the navigation bar or the page layout.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>9 hours - Coding will take some time when dealing with new languages and concepts. The better the learning and research done, the less time it should take to code the wish list. That being said an estimated total of nine hours minimum was set as there will still be times when I’ll be coding and learning at the same time.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>4 hours - For comprehensive testing, it would be vital to go back and forth from coding and testing. It would be easier to find errors along the way instead of looking through a fully coded wish list. Ideally as a test, setup one product in the database, see if it is able to be added to a wish list, then see if the wish list is then saved to a customer account. Once that has been confirmed, develop that on scale and test accordingly.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 29 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 5 to 6 working days to develop a functional wish list.</p>

  <h2>Wish List - MVF 3 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Nicholas Santosa</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>Allows customers to create an account for our store. The account could provide benefits in the long run for the customer. If they buy items from their account it could give them points which they can redeem for a discount or a prize. The account also can save the customers' wish-list and shopping cart.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>3 hours. I’ve made a few account creation forms, but I need more knowledge on what is a more effective and efficient way to create them. I've used html and javascript to create account creation and lgoins, but I need to learn how to code the account details page and how to edit it. I have made login pages and they’re really simple to create.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. I could also see other stores to see what fields are included to create an account. I need to research how to create an account details page and how to let the user edit it.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. Design is simple for a login page, account creation page and the account details page.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>8 hours. This has a lot of parts to create and with past experience in creating them, they need a lot of code to get running with all field exceptions and creating errors.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>5 hours. Testing for what is needed for customer account creation and that login, account creation and account details are simple and understandable to use.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 29 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 5 to 6 working days to develop a functional wish list.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>List of Products (database) - MVF 4 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Arjun Sharma</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>The database will contain customer and product information which is necessary for the customer accounts, wish lists and product list. The product list will take all the available products and display them in a user friendly way. </p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>6 hours. I have created databases in the past but never using amazon s3. Learning how to use amazon s3 will take the most time as I already have a decent understanding of database functionality.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. I will need to spend a little time researching sql just to refresh my current knowledge. </p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. I have already created an Entity Relationship Diagram which (which can be seen under the MVF 4 tab). If I face any issues I might need to alter the ER diagram but that should not take up too much time.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>10 hours. Coding the product list page should will take 2-3 hours and the remaining 7 hours will be dedicated to making the database functional. </p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>8 hours. Testing will need to be done in conjunction with the other MVFs that depend on the database. We will have to test many aspects of the website to make sure that information is being updated and taken correctly from the database.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 30 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 5 to 6 working days to develop a functional database and product list.</p>

  <h2>Upload Image - MVF 5.1</h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Jacob Bell</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>This feature encompasses the first of two segmented parts of our main innovative project idea, that being the Augmented reality photo feature. This section will focus on enabling the user the ability to upload their own images onto the website as well as save images generated by the AR feature. Images will be normally that of rooms or spaces in which a user would like to view a certain product in, for example; a user may wish to see how a television would look on their living room table, they would upload an image of the table, use the AR feature, an image would then be generated of the product being superimposed onto the user image and then that person would have the ability to save the image for future reference. This MVF encompases everything to do with the user uploading and saving images but not the actual generation of the images themselves, that will be discussed in MVF 6.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>The learning of how to implement a feature that allows a user to upload images to a website, have the website store said image and display said image, as well as allowing them to download the image back onto their system, although seemingly fairly simple, could prove difficult to implement in relation to my other group members work on the website. Due to this I would assume the learning process to take 4-6 hours and an additional hour or so to brush up on details while developing the feature during assignment 3.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>The research process would most likely involve viewing websites with similar features and understanding how to make the upload buttons and style easy to use and visually appealing to the user. The research may also include how to utilize some form of database for storing the images uploaded by the user. This process would take no longer than 6-7 hours, especially since my group members may already have the style for said buttons created and a few will already be working on the database portion of our website.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>The design portion will be very simple for MVF 5 as we as a group have already decided on how the overall design of the website will look, we have developed a backbone CSS file to fit said design and the upload and save image buttons will most likely fall under the file. It is simply a matter of coordinating with the group member working on MVF6 in order to get the placement of the buttons correct. As such this should take no longer than 2-3 hours at max.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>This will encompass the largest portion of time for this specific MVF. The coding section will involve the entire implementation of everything I had gathered during the previous steps and applying said information to the OES website, specifically inside the Augmented reality feature that will work in conjunction to MVF 6. As such I will again need to work closely with my group members as to who will be working on the HTML files first, who will be organising the page layout and CSS design and overall how we will all incorporate each MVF together and still retain a fully functional website. Due to this I expect this section to take upwards of 10-15 hours to complete fully by the end of the semester.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>Perhaps the most important section, the testing we will be doing will primarily involve the relationship between MVF5 and MVF6 and ensuring they work together flawlessly, a user should be able to upload a photo, generate a superimposed image and save said image all within a reasonable timeframe. As such we will spend around 7-10 hours not only on this section but on the website as a whole to ensure that it is up to par with our goals and expectations and to fix any issues that occur if said expectations are challenged.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>This MVF, although important to our overall idea will not encompass that much time in comparison to the other ones, as such, if my predictions are correct, i will have ample time to assist my teammates in producing an overall better product ahead of our submission date for our final assignment. The total time spent on this MVF will total around 30-35 or so hours.</p>

  <h2>Superimpose function- MVF 5.2</h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Joshua Kreppold</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>
    This was an important area related to our estimation plan, as obviously if we don't how to construct our feature it wouldn't be possible to create it.
    We've decide to allocte around 10 hours to this part. As if the research is done properly and we have a direction to head in. Learning how to create this shouldn't be 
    as difficult as it seems at first glance. It will specifically involve learning the languages and technology needed for the function.
  </p>

  
  <p><b>Research</b>
  </p></p>Research in relation to the this second part of MVF5 would involve researching current applications of AR technology. As the purpose of this function is to 
  superimpose an image on top of another we'd need to take proper time to investigate how this can be done and see what technologys/languages are used
 in constructing a program like this. This process should take around 6 hours to complete, and since this is a point of innovation on our website
  we want to be throurah with research related to it and how it can be done and which is the best why to do it. </p>

  <p><b>Design</b>
   </p>As we have already looked at different aspects realting to design of this function in assignment two, we predict this to be the one of the lesser time consuming aspects
   of the rest of our project. Although we still want to give a few hours to it as to be able to make any revisions that need to be done.
  <p>
    
  </p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>
    This is the area where we'd be expecting to spend a larger amount of time on. As of the point of writing this there is some coding experance throughout our group
    although we are all still learning. For this area we'd predict it to take around 10 hours, and receive input from mutiple team members over that process.  
  </p>

  <p><b>Testing </b>
  </p>This aspect will be all about making sure our product works, and making sure our users can understand it. To do this we may conduct testing within our own groop, investigating that the function actually
  fulfills it's purpose. Once we are up to a point where we are compfortable we may then conduct sumulative user testing, as to get an unbaised opinion on our product. Overall we are looking to allocate 5 hours to testing.
  
  <p>
    
  </p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>
    As this feature is our main point of innovation we are hoping to complete it to a high standard.
     Since this involves programming code 
    related to Augmented reality we need to make sure we take the extra time to research and learn how creating this feature may be possible. 
    Keeping that in mind, we are allocating 5-6 days to this function on it’s own then a further 1-2 days to implement it with the
     website
