  <h1>Detailed Estimation Plans for OES development</h1>

  <h2>Wish List - MVF 2 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Marcus</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>The wish list is to enable customers to easily pin and access their favourite products on the site. On each product page, customers will have the ability to pin an item, then access it via their “wish list”. This displays all their favourite items in one organised area so they do not need to search for it again. The wish list will also allow the user to sort how their wish list is being viewed via filters. Users will be able to sort their wish list by most recently added, price and in alphabetical order of product.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>9 hours - Taking into account how little experience I have with PHP, it would be essential to look and work through different tutorials and examples on how to develop a wish list. I will also be learning how to work with multiple databases, one being the product database and the other being the customer accounts. I will be learning how to pull information from each database and display that information in the wish list. I will also need to learn how to update a database when something is added to the wish list, it will need to be saved to the customer account database.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>5 hours - Research would require me to find different resources and tools to implement in my wish list. An aspect not to be overlooked is also how a wish list is to be displayed to the user, hence looking at other sites with wish lists will be helpful in designing our wish list. Importantly I will have to do some research on PHP and how to leverage that to build this MVF.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>2 hours - With the research to be done on how a wish list should be designed, the overall time to complete the design should only take a maximum of two hours. This is also taking into account that page frameworks would have already been established, so there will be no need to design other features such as the navigation bar or the page layout.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>9 hours - Coding will take some time when dealing with new languages and concepts. The better the learning and research done, the less time it should take to code the wish list. That being said an estimated total of nine hours minimum was set as there will still be times when I’ll be coding and learning at the same time.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>4 hours - For comprehensive testing, it would be vital to go back and forth from coding and testing. It would be easier to find errors along the way instead of looking through a fully coded wish list. Ideally as a test, setup one product in the database, see if it is able to be added to a wish list, then see if the wish list is then saved to a customer account. Once that has been confirmed, develop that on scale and test accordingly.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 29 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 5 to 6 working days to develop a functional wish list.</p>

  <h2>Wish List - MVF 3 </h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Nicholas Santosa</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>Allows customers to create an account for our store. The account could provide benefits in the long run for the customer. If they buy items from their account it could give them points which they can redeem for a discount or a prize. The account also can save the customers' wish-list and shopping cart.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>3 hours. I’ve made a few account creation forms, but I need more knowledge on what is a more effective and efficient way to create them. I've used html and javascript to create account creation and lgoins, but I need to learn how to code the account details page and how to edit it. I have made login pages and they’re really simple to create.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. I could also see other stores to see what fields are included to create an account. I need to research how to create an account details page and how to let the user edit it.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>2 hours. Design is simple for a login page, account creation page and the account details page.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>8 hours. This has a lot of parts to create and with past experience in creating them, they need a lot of code to get running with all field exceptions and creating errors.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>5 hours. Testing for what is needed for customer account creation and that login, account creation and account details are simple and understandable to use.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>With a total of 29 hours, a feasible spread of the workload would be an estimated 5 to 6 working days to develop a functional wish list.</p>

  <h2>Upload Image - MVF 5.1</h2>
  <p>Team member in charge of MVF - Jacob Bell</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Description of feature - </i></p>
  <p>This feature encompasses the first of two segmented parts of our main innovative project idea, that being the Augmented reality photo feature. This section will focus on enabling the user the ability to upload their own images onto the website as well as save images generated by the AR feature. Images will be normally that of rooms or spaces in which a user would like to view a certain product in, for example; a user may wish to see how a television would look on their living room table, they would upload an image of the table, use the AR feature, an image would then be generated of the product being superimposed onto the user image and then that person would have the ability to save the image for future reference. This MVF encompases everything to do with the user uploading and saving images but not the actual generation of the images themselves, that will be discussed in MVF 6.</p>

  <br>

  <p><i>Estimation of timeline for full development - </i></p>

  <p><b>Learning </b></p>
  <p>The learning of how to implement a feature that allows a user to upload images to a website, have the website store said image and display said image, as well as allowing them to download the image back onto their system, although seemingly fairly simple, could prove difficult to implement in relation to my other group members work on the website. Due to this I would assume the learning process to take 4-6 hours and an additional hour or so to brush up on details while developing the feature during assignment 3.</p>

  <p><b>Research</b></p>
  <p>The research process would most likely involve viewing websites with similar features and understanding how to make the upload buttons and style easy to use and visually appealing to the user. The research may also include how to utilize some form of database for storing the images uploaded by the user. This process would take no longer than 6-7 hours, especially since my group members may already have the style for said buttons created and a few will already be working on the database portion of our website.</p>

  <p><b>Design</b></p>
  <p>The design portion will be very simple for MVF 5 as we as a group have already decided on how the overall design of the website will look, we have developed a backbone CSS file to fit said design and the upload and save image buttons will most likely fall under the file. It is simply a matter of coordinating with the group member working on MVF6 in order to get the placement of the buttons correct. As such this should take no longer than 2-3 hours at max.</p>

  <p><b>Coding</b></p>
  <p>This will encompass the largest portion of time for this specific MVF. The coding section will involve the entire implementation of everything I had gathered during the previous steps and applying said information to the OES website, specifically inside the Augmented reality feature that will work in conjunction to MVF 6. As such I will again need to work closely with my group members as to who will be working on the HTML files first, who will be organising the page layout and CSS design and overall how we will all incorporate each MVF together and still retain a fully functional website. Due to this I expect this section to take upwards of 10-15 hours to complete fully by the end of the semester.</p>

  <p><b>Testing </b></p>
  <p>Perhaps the most important section, the testing we will be doing will primarily involve the relationship between MVF5 and MVF6 and ensuring they work together flawlessly, a user should be able to upload a photo, generate a superimposed image and save said image all within a reasonable timeframe. As such we will spend around 7-10 hours not only on this section but on the website as a whole to ensure that it is up to par with our goals and expectations and to fix any issues that occur if said expectations are challenged.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <p>This MVF, although important to our overall idea will not encompass that much time in comparison to the other ones, as such, if my predictions are correct, i will have ample time to assist my teammates in producing an overall better product ahead of our submission date for our final assignment. The total time spent on this MVF will total around 30-35 or so hours.</p>
